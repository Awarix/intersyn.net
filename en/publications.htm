	<br>
	In this paper the method of circuit synthesis using transformation of trees with pathological elements is discussed. The generalization and mathematical proof of equivalent transformations of trees with mirror and/or nullor pathological elements are presented. Algorithm of generating equivalent trees with these pathological elements is also suggested. It is based on tagging of the vertices (nodes) by taking into account a type of pathological elements between these nodes and preserving these tags during transformations of trees. Illustrative example of universal filter synthesis by means of proposed algorithm is included.

	<br>
	The parameter extraction technique for symbolic analysis of switched capacitors circuits have been presented. The proposed extraction formulae reduce of cancellation sum-of-product terms amount in transfer function expression. For equivalent circuits of SC the models based on voltage controlled current sources with capacities parameters have been used to avoid the cancellations appearance at the circuit level. The proposed technique is implemented in symbolic circuit analysis program Cirsym. Illustrative examples on SC circuit symbolic analysis are given.

	<br>
	The generalization of Bode’s sensitivity analysis technique for all types of the transfer functions and circuit elements is presented in the paper. The proposed formulae for first- and second-order symbolic sensitivity calculation provide the compact size of obtained expression and have the advantages of cancellation-free sum-of-product terms and matrix-free computation. This is achieved by means of the concept of high order summative cofactors and the generalized parameter extraction method. The proposed technique is implemented in symbolic circuit analysis program Cirsym. Illustrative example on symbolic sensitivity circuit analysis and comparison of the presented technique with the transimpedance method and the method based on the modified Coates flow-graph are given.

<br>
	The new topological rules providing symbolic analysis
	of the networks with pathological mirror elements have been
	proposed. The approach is based on generalized parameter
	extraction method and it doesn't require presentation of the
	circuit in matrix or oriented graph form. The main advantage of
	this method is that there are no reductions of the generated terms
	of symbolic expressions. The method has been implemented in
	the computer program SCADS. A discussion of theoretical basics
	as well as results of the calculation is included.

<br>
	In this paper we present a simple technique of analog electronic circuits synthesis by means of a linear representation. The approach is based on generalized parameter extraction method. It describes the procedure for developing the circuit topology both for passive or active circuits. The input data for the proposed synthesis method are the arbitrary network function approximated in polynomial form and specified elements set. In contrast to other synthesis approaches the proposed technique provides the realization of full set of equivalent circuits and allow to choose the best circuit solutions by various criteria. Experiments conducted on the low-pass filter design demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of synthesis method.

	A new method of the symbolic circuit tolerance analysis has been proposed. The approach is based on Middlebrook’s extra element
	theorem and the generalized parameter extraction method. It does not need the matrix network description or presentation as
	algebraic sets or topological graphs. The proposed techniques have been realized in the computer program (Toleralize). To verify
	the theoretical analysis, computer simulation results are included.

	extended to networks with controlled sources. The method proposed here, unlike that proposed by Barrows and Hoang, does not require laborious enumeration of
	transfer loop circuits.
